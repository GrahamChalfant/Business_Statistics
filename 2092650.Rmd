# Question 1 Section 1

## Impact of Store Layout on Average Sales

The t-test for sales gain by 'intrial' returns a t(483.08) = -5.7173, P-value = 1.44e-08. Based on this data, it is evident that there is a large difference between sales gain for stores that are and are not participating in the trial. Because of this, we reject the null hypothesis and say that sales gain for stores participating in the trial is definitely different from stores not participating in the trial.

The difference in sales gain controlling for 'intrial' can be seen below in Figure 1.

![Figure 1: Sales Gain by Intrial](sales_gain_contrast_intrial.png)

The mean sales gain for stores not participating in the trial is 18,642 GBP, 95% CI[ -78,661 -- 115,946] GBP. The mean sales gain for stores participating in the trial is 426,893 GBP, 95% CI[327,214 -- 526,572] GBP. The mean sales gain for stores not participating in the trial is 408,250 GBP less, 95% CI[-547,548 -- -268,953] GBP, than stores participating in the trial. Stores participating in the trial have a higher mean sales gain compared to stores not participating in the trial.

The estimation approach data is visualized below in Figure 2 and 3.

![Figure 2: Average Sales Gain by Intrail](sales_gain_gbp.png){width="50%"}![Figure 3: Average Percent Gain by Intrail](sales_gain_percent.png){width="50%"}

Figure 2: Average Sales Gain by 'Intrail' --- Figure 3: Average Percent Gain by 'Intrial'

## Optimal Dependent Varaible

There are two reasons why change in percentage should be used of change in GBP: 1) sales gain as a percentage is more normal and does not have outliers (see figure ) 2) sales gain as a percentage is more intuitive as fluctuations in \$X could be considered very small in context of a large store and enormous in context in of a small store. Using a proportion measure accounts for this difference. 

![Figure 3: Percent Sales Gain by intrial](percent_sales_gain_by_intial.png)

Although, it should be noted that 'intrial' can predict over two times the amount of variance in 'sales_change' than it can in 'percentage_diff.' Additionally, the P-value for 'sales_change' explained by 'intrial' is far more significant than 'percentage_diff.'

### R-squared of Different Dependent Variables

| Model                      | R-squared |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| sales_change \~ intrial    | 0.05638   |
| percentage_diff \~ intrial | 0.01755   |

### P-value for different Dependent Variables

| Model                      | P-value   |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| sales_change \~ intrial    | 1.898e-08 |
| percentage_diff \~ intrial | 0.001294  |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 2 Section 1

## Impact of Outlet Type and Trial on Percent Sales Gain

Using t-test on a linear model of 'percentage_diff' as a function of 'intrial' and 'outlettype' reveals that percent sales gain differs by outlettype, t(2, 533) = 57.934, p \< 2.2e -16.

In addition, the estimation approach confirms the NHT. Seen below in figure 4, the percent sales gain by outlet type and trial has been visualized. The confidence intervals for the stores which are not intrial overlap zero. It cannot be said that the percent sales gain for stores which are not intrial is different than zero. The estimated confidence intervals can be seen below.

| 'outlettype' and 'intrial' interaction      | lower.CL | upper.CL | emmean  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| intrialTRUE:city_center_convenience         |  -5.387  | -3.586   | -4.4865 |
| intrialTRUE:outlettypecommunity_convenience |  3.002   | 4.323    | 3.6624  |
| intrialTRUE:outlettypesuperstore            |  2.688   | 4.783    | 3.7355  |

| 'outlettype' and 'intrial' interaction       | lower.CL | upper.CL | emmean  |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| intrialFALSE:city_center_convenience         | -0.908   | 0.724    | -0.0925 |
| intrialFALSE:outlettypecommunity_convenience | -0.494   | 0.836    | 0.1710  |
| intrialFALSE:outlettypesuperstore            | -0.789   | 1.326    | 0.2682  |


In summary, 'intrial' and 'outlettype' both influence percent sales gain. Figure 4 shows that stores which are not intiral did not experience a change in percent sales gain. Additionally, 'community_convenience' and 'superstore' which are intrial experienced an increase in percent sales gain. In contrast, 'city_centre_convenience' saw a decline in percent sales gain for stores which were intrial. 

![Figure 4: Percent Sales Gain by Outlet type](percent_sales_gain_by_intrial_and_outlettype.png)

## Impact of Outlet Type, Trial, and Staff Turnover on Percent Sales Gain

Comparing models with and without 'staff_turnover' using ANOVA reveals it does not improve the model significantly, F(533) = 0.2894, p < 0.5908. The adjusted r-squares are also very similar for the two models. 

| With and without 'staff_turnover'   | Adj. R-squared |
|-------------------------------------|--------------- |
| With 'staff_turnover'               | 0.3073         | 
| Without 'staff_turnover'            | 0.3082         | 


Additionally, the effects of 'staff_turnover' using the estimation approach can be seen below in Figure 5. From the chart, it is evident that 'staff_turnover' does not influence the sales gain at different outlet types.

# Data Understanding

Reading in Data and Checking Integrity

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("sales_data.txt", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#str(data) 

#summary(data) 
```

Checking Data for Outliers

Note: I believe the results would have been much different if outliers were removed, but because of the lack of information, I did not remove the majority of the potential outliers. For future analysis, I would recommend identifying the reasons for the potential outliers, and if they are identified as actual outliers, remove them.

```{r}
boxplot(data$staff_turnover)

#boxplot(data$sales_1)

#boxplot(data$sales_2)

data <- subset(data, staff_turnover < 0.039476) #Removing one extreme point which is very different from all other observations
